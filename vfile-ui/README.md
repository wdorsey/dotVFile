# dotVFile UI

WIP [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app to provide a read-only UI of a dotVFile system.

## TODO

- FileExplorer
  - Display directory and file count for current directory path.
    - add in between path and file explorer rows
  - Display counts/size for each directory/file row
    - Directory: Directory Count, File Count, Size? Not sure on this, need to look at vfile stats per directory
    - File: display file size
