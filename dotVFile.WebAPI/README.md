# dotVFile WebAPI

This is a C# WebAPI that wraps the [dotVFile library](https://github.com/wdorsey/dotVFile/tree/master/dotVFile) to provide vfile information to the [frontend vfile explorer UI](https://github.com/wdorsey/dotVFile/tree/master/vfile-ui).

Just run it and that's it.
- It's set up so that when running locally it does not do an https redirect so that the http endpoint can be called locally by the frontend UI.
